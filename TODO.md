# A new backend for goals

I should add a new backend, where you can define direct goals and their deadlines and how much money you get for them

# A "CombineBackends" function or class, which lets you specify multiple backends to be used

# Add a system for showing statistics

Basic things such as gold and dust over time
Reward usages, pack usages etc.

But also add an entry point so the backends can also display their own statistics.
